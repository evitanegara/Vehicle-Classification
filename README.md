# Business Understanding
 
Vehicle classification is a critical component of Intelligent Traffic Systems (ITS), contributing to the efficiency of smart cities by improving traffic management, reducing congestion, and enhancing road safety. Accurately identifying vehicle types helps optimize toll collection, traffic flow monitoring, and parking lot utilization.

# Project Objective
•  The goal of this project is to classify five distinct types of vehicles.

•  Various machine learning and deep learning models were applied, including: Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), Random Forest, Ensemble Learning (Stacking and Voting) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Fully connected neural network

•  Dataset: The dataset used can be accessed here.
